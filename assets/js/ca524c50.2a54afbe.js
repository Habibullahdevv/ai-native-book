Physical AI, designed for learners and practitioners alike.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module1/chapter-1":{"id":"module1/chapter-1","title":"Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Robotics","description":"The field of robotics has undergone a dramatic transformation, moving from pre-programmed industrial arms to sophisticated autonomous agents capable of learning and adapting. This evolution is largely driven by the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), giving rise to what we term \\"Physical AI.\\" Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute actions within the physical world, often through embodied forms like robots. This capability extends beyond mere automation; it involves true cognitive functions that allow machines to interact intelligently and flexibly with complex, unstructured environments. This introductory chapter lays the groundwork by defining key terms, tracing historical developments, and outlining the interdisciplinary nature of this rapidly advancing field.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module1/chapter-2":{"id":"module1/chapter-2","title":"Chapter 2: Robot Kinematics and Dynamics","description":"To effectively control a robot, one must understand its motion capabilities and how forces affect its movement. This is where robot kinematics and dynamics come into play. These two fundamental areas form the mathematical bedrock for designing, simulating, and controlling physical AI systems, enabling them to execute precise motions and interact dynamically with their environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module1/chapter-3":{"id":"module1/chapter-3","title":"Chapter 3: Sensing and Perception for Robotics","description":"For a physical AI system to interact intelligently and autonomously with its environment, it must first be able to perceive it accurately and robustly. Sensing and perception are the robot\'s fundamental gateways to understanding the world around it, its own state, and the presence and behavior of other agents. This process involves two main stages: sensing, which converts physical phenomena into measurable electrical signals, and perception, which interprets these signals to construct a meaningful, actionable representation of the environment. The quality and reliability of these perceptions directly impact a robot\'s ability to make informed decisions, plan movements, and execute tasks effectively.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module1/chapter-4":{"id":"module1/chapter-4","title":"Chapter 4: Actuation and Control Systems","description":"Actuation and control systems are the muscle and nervous system of a robot, respectively, translating abstract computational commands into physical motion and ensuring these motions are executed precisely, stably, and safely. Actuators are the components responsible for generating motion or force, while control systems provide the intelligence to regulate these actuators, allowing the robot to perform its intended tasks in a coordinated and effective manner.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module1/chapter-5":{"id":"module1/chapter-5","title":"Chapter 5: Introduction to Robot Operating System (ROS)","description":"The Robot Operating System (ROS) is not an operating system in the traditional sense, but rather a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a meta-operating system that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviors across a wide variety of robotic platforms. ROS provides OS-like functionality on a heterogeneous computer cluster, including hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. Mastering ROS is often considered a crucial step for anyone venturing into serious robotics development, as it fosters modularity, reusability, and a vibrant open-source community.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module1/index":{"id":"module1/index","title":"Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI","description":"This module lays the groundwork for understanding how artificial intelligence is integrated into physical robotic systems, focusing on the core principles that enable robots to interact with their environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module2/chapter1":{"id":"module2/chapter1","title":"Chapter 1: Gait Generation: Kinematics and Dynamics","description":"1.1 Introduction to Humanoid Gait","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module2/chapter2":{"id":"module2/chapter2","title":"Chapter 2: Zero Moment Point (ZMP) Control and Balance","description":"2.1 Understanding the Zero Moment Point (ZMP)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module2/chapter3":{"id":"module2/chapter3","title":"Chapter 3: Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) Models","description":"3.1 Introduction to SLIP Models","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module2/chapter4":{"id":"module2/chapter4","title":"Chapter 4: Locomotion Planning and Stability Margins","description":"4.1 Introduction to Locomotion Planning","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module2/chapter5":{"id":"module2/chapter5","title":"Chapter 5: Real-world Humanoid Walking Systems","description":"5.1 Introduction to Humanoid Robotics Platforms","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module2/index":{"id":"module2/index","title":"Module 2: Human Locomotion, Balance, and Control in Humanoid Robotics","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module3/chapter1":{"id":"module3/chapter1","title":"Computer Vision in Robotics","description":"Computer vision is a crucial component in modern robotics, enabling machines to \\"see\\" and interpret their environment.

This chapter delves into the principles and techniques behind fusing data from disparate sensors, enhancing a robot\'s perception capabilities beyond what a single sensor could provide.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module3/chapter3":{"id":"module3/chapter3","title":"SLAM & Spatial Understanding","description":"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental problem in robotics, enabling a robot to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking its own pose (position and orientation) within that map. For AI-powered robots, especially humanoids, robust SLAM and spatial understanding are critical for autonomous navigation, interaction, and task execution. This chapter explores various SLAM techniques and how they contribute to a robot\'s spatial awareness, with a focus on NVIDIA Isaac ROS integration.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module3/chapter4":{"id":"module3/chapter4","title":"Sensor Calibration","description":"Accurate sensor data is paramount for robust robotic perception, navigation, and manipulation. Before any meaningful data fusion or SLAM can occur, all sensors on a robot must be carefully calibrated. Sensor calibration is the process of determining the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each sensor, ensuring that their measurements are accurate and that their spatial relationships to each other and to the robot\'s body are precisely known. This chapter details essential sensor calibration techniques for common robotic sensors.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module3/chapter5":{"id":"module3/chapter5","title":"AI Reasoning in Robotics Systems","description":"AI reasoning is the ability of a robot to process information, make decisions, plan actions, and adapt to its environment in an intelligent manner. In the context of the AI-Robot Brain, this involves moving beyond basic perception and control to higher-level cognitive functions that enable autonomous and adaptive behavior. This chapter explores how AI reasoning is applied in robotics, integrating concepts from machine learning, symbolic AI, and cognitive architectures, with a focus on how NVIDIA Isaac platform components facilitate these advanced capabilities.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module3/index":{"id":"module3/index","title":"Module 3: Perception and Intelligence in Physical AI Systems","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"module4/chapter1":{"id":"module4/chapter1","title":"Human-Robot Interaction Models","description":"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a multidisciplinary field focused on the design, implementation, and evaluation of robotic systems that interact with humans.
