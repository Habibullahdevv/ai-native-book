# Module 3: Perception and Intelligence in Physical AI Systems

## Overview

This module explores the critical role of perception and artificial intelligence in enabling physical AI systems, particularly humanoid robots, to understand and interact with their environment. We will cover various sensing modalities, data fusion techniques, spatial understanding, and the integration of AI reasoning for robust and intelligent robotic behaviors. The chapters will delve into both theoretical concepts and practical applications.
