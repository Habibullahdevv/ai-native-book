  "description": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental problem in robotics, enabling a robot to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking its own pose (position and orientation) within that map. For AI-powered robots, especially humanoids, robust SLAM and spatial understanding are critical for autonomous navigation, interaction, and task execution. This chapter explores various SLAM techniques and how they contribute to a robot's spatial awareness, with a focus on NVIDIA Isaac ROS integration.",
