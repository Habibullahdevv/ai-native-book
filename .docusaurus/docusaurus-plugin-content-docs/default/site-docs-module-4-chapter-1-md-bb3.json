  "description": "Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a multidisciplinary field focused on the design, implementation, and evaluation of robotic systems that interact with humans. As robots become more sophisticated and integrated into our daily lives, understanding and optimizing these interactions is crucial for their effective and safe deployment. This chapter explores various models and paradigms of HRI, providing a foundation for designing intuitive and natural interactions between humans and humanoid robots.",
