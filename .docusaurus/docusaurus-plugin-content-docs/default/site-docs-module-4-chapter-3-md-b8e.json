  "description": "As robots become more autonomous and increasingly interact with humans in shared environments, two critical areas come to the forefront: social robotics and safety engineering. Social robotics focuses on designing robots that can engage with humans in a natural and socially acceptable manner, while safety engineering ensures that these interactions are free from harm. This chapter explores the principles behind creating socially intelligent robots and the essential safety protocols and design considerations for human-robot collaboration.",
