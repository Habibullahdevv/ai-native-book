  "description": "Computer vision is a crucial component in modern robotics, enabling machines to \"see\" and interpret their environment. In the context of the AI-Robot Brain, computer vision pipelines process raw sensor data from cameras and depth sensors to extract meaningful information for perception, navigation, and manipulation. This chapter explores the fundamentals of computer vision as applied to robotics, with a focus on its integration with NVIDIA Isaac platform components like Isaac ROS.",
