  "title": "AI Reasoning in Robotics Systems",
  "description": "AI reasoning is the ability of a robot to process information, make decisions, plan actions, and adapt to its environment in an intelligent manner. In the context of the AI-Robot Brain, this involves moving beyond basic perception and control to higher-level cognitive functions that enable autonomous and adaptive behavior. This chapter explores how AI reasoning is applied in robotics, integrating concepts from machine learning, symbolic AI, and cognitive architectures, with a focus on how NVIDIA Isaac platform components facilitate these advanced capabilities.",
