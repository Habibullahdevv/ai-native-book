## Prompt

/sp.implement enhance-module-1: expand-depth, add-diagrams, add-code-examples, add-ethics, add-crossrefs

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file, which is required for implementation, is missing. Please run `/sp.tasks` to regenerate the task list before attempting to implement.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified missing `tasks.md` file.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to run `/sp.tasks`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Halting implementation due to missing `tasks.md`.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Missing required input file for command execution.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
