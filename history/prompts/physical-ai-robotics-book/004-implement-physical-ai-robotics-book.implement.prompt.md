## Prompt

/sp.implement

Goal:
Begin implementing the book “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” following the constitution, plan, and tasks already defined.

Implementation Scope (initial phase):
1) Set up project skeleton for the book.
2) Generate module outlines (high-level only).
3) Produce first-pass drafts for Module 1, Chapter 1 (intro + structure).
4) Ensure all outputs follow clarity + accuracy requirements.

Instructions:
- Use concise, academically clear language.
- Keep drafts lightweight at this stage (no full word count yet).
- Reference core robotics concepts but avoid long citations; placeholders allowed.
- Maintain the structure needed for later expansion in Docusaurus.
- Do not exceed safe token limits.

Deliverables for this run:
- Project scaffold outline (folders + files).
- Draft: Book introduction (200–300 words).
- Module 1 outline (5 chapters with learning goals).
- Draft for Module 1, Chapter 1 (300–400 words).
- Summary of next steps for continuation.

End.
