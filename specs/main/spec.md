Plan:
Clean and fix the AI Native Book Docusaurus repository.
Ensure all book content is in the correct source folders, the sidebar is in the proper order, the footer includes all modules, and a homepage exists.
All changes should be committed, merged safely if needed, pushed to GitHub, and deployed on GitHub Pages.
Auto-generated or ignored folders like build/ or node_modules/ must not be modified.
