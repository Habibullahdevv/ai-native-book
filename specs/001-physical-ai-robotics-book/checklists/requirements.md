# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md](specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This specification is for a book's constitution, which defines its high-level structure and purpose. As such, detailed "acceptance scenarios" or "user scenarios" and "functional requirements" in the traditional software sense are not applicable. The success criteria defined in the constitution are at the book level.
- The checklist items "All acceptance scenarios are defined", "Edge cases are identified", "All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria", and "User scenarios cover primary flows" are marked as incomplete due to the nature of this "constitution" spec. These are more relevant for a software feature spec.
